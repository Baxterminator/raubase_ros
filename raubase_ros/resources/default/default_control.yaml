#  This file contains the configurations needed for using the velocity 
#  controller.

pid:
  pid_freq: -1 # PID frequency, -1 for acting when receiving odometry data
  velocity:
    vpid_kp: 7.0  # Potential gain for the velocity PID (in V per m/s)
    vpid_td: 0.0  # Lead time constant for velocity PID (in s)
    vpid_ad: 1.0  # Lead alpha value for the velocity PID (in [0, 1])
    vpid_ti: 0.05 # Integrator time constant for the velocity PID (in s)
  heading:

limits:
